# hehe-antivirus
Now days due to some problem, hosting company is forcing us to get sitelock, which i think its not so important. So what hosting companies provide us is with a .txt file which contains all the effected files in your hosting, So here i have made a sort of antivirus which actually takes from your that malware.txt file and removes or quarantine the infected files. Use it on your own risk, if you want to contribute to make this as full fledged antivirus with scanning facility then do support and let us know. 

## How to use
Step1: Just Create a folder in your shared hosting (or above) and upload this file there.

Step2: Download the malware.txt from your server (if your dont have it then kindly call your hosting provider and ask to run ClamAV or any antivirus program, in the 
result you will get a text file of infected files.)

Step3: Open hehe_av.php in browser and Upload or add path of that malware.text and then click start. You see the infected files gets deleted in less than a second. ;P
