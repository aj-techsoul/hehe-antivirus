# hehe-antivirus
Now days due to some problem, hosting company is forcing us to get sitelock, which i think its not so important. So what hosting companies provide us is with a .txt file which contains all the effected files in your hosting, So here i have made a sort of antivirus which actually takes from your that malware.txt file and removes or quarantine the infected files. Use it on your own risk, if you want to contribute to make this as full fledged antivirus with scanning facility then do support and let us know.
